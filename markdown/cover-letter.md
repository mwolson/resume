Hi,

I think I could be a good fit for your **Director** role. I have the following qualifications that apply:

* Experience with using the Smarty templating system for PHP, an inspiration for Liquid's templates.
* Experience with different CDNs such as Fastly and custom-developed caching systems.
* Experience scaling frontend and backend systems.
* Experience with large-scale E-Commerce at Ticketmaster.
* Development of best practices and team documentation while leading frontend and stream-aligned teams.

Thanks for your consideration,

Mike
