**TigerConnect: Staff Engineer, Sr. Manager** (2017-2024)

Improved various features on the existing messenger app, which is used by doctors and nurses at hospitals to reduce the number of fatal accidents, improve staff retention and happiness, and cut wait times for the ER by about half.

Staff Engineer:
:    **React-based Messenger App:** Improved page load performance, build pipeline performance, and responsiveness under load.
:    **Electron Desktop App**: Wrote a TypeScript Electron app to allow the Messenger website to run with additional functionality such as native OS notifications for incoming messages and alerts. Extended 5+ npm libraries to provide early support for a new version of Electron.
:    **Cloudfront Node.js Lambda:** Wrote sophisticated routing and support for rolling deployments to 4 US regions, as well as the company's only unit testing and integration testing of a single layer of infrastructure.
:    **Customer Support:** Interfaced with a 1MM+ ARR customer to solve complex responsiveness problems with the Messenger app, providing a multi-stage plan along with presenting timely updates as the work progressed. Result: Customer was impressed and retained their subscription.

Sr. Manager:
:    **Upleveling:** Mentored engineers and guided them towards achieving their goals, facilitating career advancement.
:    **Quality Control:** Added linters to the team projects to speed up code reviews and catch mistakes early.
:    **On-time Delivery:** Guided the team to provide accurate high-level and mid-level project estimates. Result: the team completed projects on time using Agile/SCRUM methodologies.

**Ticketmaster: Sr. Engineer** (2008-2016)

:    Wrote Node.js Platform Microservice that scaled to 1MM+ requests per day, supported with custom analytics and reporting.
:    Supported and main production websites written in Java, Perl, and React for displaying event information and purchasing events. Helped prepare for very large amounts of traffic during onsale situations and developed load tests. Helped migrate to Docker.
:    Cut request latency in half for a data orchestration service by placing a CDN in front of it. Wrote unit tests for the CDN integration along with a [custom Bash framework](https://github.com/mwolson/barrt-sh) to run them.
:    Helped spin up and configure the company's GitLab instance, and wrote presentations to advise on Git and GitLab as key technology choices to replace SVN.
:    Had involvement in the early development idea for [Talkback](https://github.com/ijpiantanida/talkback) while the author contracted for Ticketmaster, and adapted our integration test suite to use it. Talkback is a JS proxy that allowe requests to multiple local services to be captured together and replayed for reproducible and maintainable integration tests.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**
